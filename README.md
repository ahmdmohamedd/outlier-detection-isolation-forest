# outlier-detection-isolation-forest
This project demonstrates outlier detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm. A synthetic dataset with clusters and added anomalies is generated, and Isolation Forest is applied to detect and label outliers. The project includes data visualization for identifying anomalies and can be adapted for any dataset with anomalies.
